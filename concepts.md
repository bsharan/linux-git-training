# Git Concepts — Day 1 (summary)

- What is Git: distributed VCS
- Commits are snapshots (SHA-1)
- Three areas: working dir → staging (index) → repository
- Branching: create isolated timelines
- Remotes: origin (your GitHub repo) and push/pull workflow
- SSH auth: use id_ed25519
- Next: branching, PRs, merge conflicts, .gitignore, aliases
